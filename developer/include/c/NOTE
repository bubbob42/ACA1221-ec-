Note:

The inline files in directory inline will work with GCC.
The pragma files will work with SAS, Maxon, Storm, Dice and Aztec compiler.
The proto files will work with all of these compilers!

All these files were automatically made either by FD2Pragma.

For GCC you may delete the pragma directory.

For all the others you may delete the inline directory, but use pragma
instead. Do not rename pragma to pragmas or change the file names! When
pragma does not exist, please create it.

You do not need to modify any of the include files or change their names!
