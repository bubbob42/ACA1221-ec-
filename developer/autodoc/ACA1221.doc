    NAME
        ACA1221_GetCurrentSpeed -- determine the current speed values of the card

   SYNOPSIS
        speedinfo = ACA1221_GetCurrentSpeed()
        D0

        struct ClockInfo *ACA1221_GetCurrentSpeed(void);

   FUNCTION
        Read current speed setting of the card. Returns a pointer to
        an internal library structure. Both actual clock value
        (STRPTR) and speed stepping (UWORD) will be returned.													*

   INPUTS
        none

   RESULT
        speedinfo - pointer to struct ClockInfo (see ACA1221.h) or NULL

   EXAMPLE
        struct ClockInfo *ACASpeed = NULL:

        ACASpeed = ACA1221_GetCurrentSpeed();

        Printf("My current speed stepping is %ld (%s)",
                  ACASpeed->ci_CPUSpeedStep, ACASpeed->ci_CPUClock);

   NOTES
        Any task accessing the library may call ACA1221_SetSpeed(), so always
        call ACA1221_GetCurrentSpeed() right before you process the ClockInfo
        values.

   NAME
        ACA1221_GetMaxSpeed() - determine the maximum speed setting of the card

   SYNOPSIS
        speedinfo =	ACA1221_GetMaxSpeed();
        D0

        struct ClockInfo *ACA1221_GetMaxSpeed(void);

   FUNCTION
        Read maximum speed setting of the card. Returns a pointer to
        an internal library structure. Both actual clock value
        (STRPTR) and speed stepping (UWORD) will be returned.

   INPUTS
        none

   RESULT
        speedinfo - pointer to struct ClockInfo (see ACA1221.h) or NULL

   EXAMPLE
        struct ClockInfo *ACAMaxSpeed = NULL:

        ACAMaxSpeed = ACA1221_GetMaxSpeed();

        Printf("My maximum speed stepping is %ld (%s)",
                  ACAMaxSpeed->ci_CPUSpeedStep, ACAMaxSpeed->ci_CPUClock);

   NOTES
        The maximum speed is determined by the current license status of the
        card. The status can be checked via the tool "ACAControl" supplied
        with the card.

   NAME
        ACA1221_MapROM() - Maps/unmaps Kickstart ROM to/from FastRAM

   SYNOPSIS
        success = ACA1221_MapROM(file, option);
        D0                       D0    D1

        BOOL ACA1221_MapROM(STRPTR, LONG);

   FUNCTION
        Maps Kickstart ROM to the contents of a file which will be copied to
        FastRAM beforehand.Supply AR_MAPINT as option argument to use the
        internal physical Kickstart ROM as the source or supply AR_MAPREMOVE to
        deactivate the MapROM feature. If you supply an option, "file" should
        be NULL, but will be ignored anyway.

   INPUTS
        file   - pointer to a filenameor NULL
        option - one of the options AR_MAPREMOVE, AR_MAPINT

   RESULT
        success - TRUE, if the card accepts the setting, otherwise FALSE.

   EXAMPLE
        BOOL success = FALSE;
        STRPTR file = "kickstart.rom";
        ...

        success = MapROM(file, 0);

        if (success) {
            Printf("Contents of the file have been mapped as Kickstart ROM\n");
        }

   NAME
        ACA1221_SetSpeed - changes the current speed setting of the card

   SYNOPSIS
        Success = ACA1221_SetSpeed(speedStepping);
        D0                 D0

        BOOL ACA1221_SetSpeed(UBYTE);

   FUNCTION
        Change the current speed setting of the card to the supplied stepping.
        The setting is in effect until the next flip of the power switch.

   INPUTS
        speedStepping   - binary value, a fully licensed ACA1221 supports
                          stepping 0-3, which correspond to the following
                          clock values:

                          0: 9.46 MHz
                          1: 17.03 MHz
                          2: 21.28 MHz
                          3: 28.38 MHz (42.56 MHz in overdrive mode)

                          the  ACA1221EC always supports stepping 0-3,
                          which correspond to the following clock values:

                          0: 17.03 MHz
                          1: 21.28 MHz
                          2: 28.38 MHz
                          3: 42.56 MHz (will only work with CPU mask E13G!)


   RESULT
        success - TRUE, if the card accepts the setting, otherwise FALSE. You
                  may check this by calling ACA1221_GetCurrentSpeed() after
                  ACA1221_SetSpeed().

   EXAMPLE
        BOOL success = FALSE;
        UBYTE mySpeed = 2;

        success = ACA1221_SetSpeed(mySpeed);

        if (success) {
            Printf("My speed stepping has been set to %ld\n", mySpeed);
        }

   NOTES
        For the ACA1221, the maximum speed available is determined by the
        current license status of the card, while all speed steps are always
        available for the 1221EC.
        You get the maximum speed stepping by calling ACA1221_GetMaxSpeed().
        The license status of the ACA1221 can be checked via the tool
        "ACAControl" supplied with the card.

        You may call the function anytime without the need to disable
        multitasking. Other tasks (e.g. formatting disks, etc.) will not be
        disturbed.
